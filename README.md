# 😊 Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews to identify
whether the sentiment expressed is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.
It was developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship**.

The project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
can be applied to real-world text data using simple and beginner-friendly tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer reviews using sentiment analysis
- Classify reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral
- Understand basic NLP concepts using Python
- Visualize sentiment distribution
- Build an internship-ready data analytics project

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- TextBlob
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of customer review text data.
Each review represents customer feedback about a product or service.

**Sample Reviews:**
- "This product is amazing"
- "Very bad quality"
- "I am happy with the service"
- "Worst experience ever"
- "Average product"

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Created a dataset of customer reviews
2. Used TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity
3. Classified sentiment based on polarity score:
   - Positive (polarity > 0)
   - Negative (polarity < 0)
   - Neutral (polarity = 0)
4. Stored results in a Pandas DataFrame
5. Visualized sentiment distribution using a bar chart

---

## 📊 Results
- Positive reviews indicate customer satisfaction
- Negative reviews highlight dissatisfaction
- Sentiment distribution provides quick insight into overall customer feedback

---

## 📈 Visualization
- Bar chart representing count of Positive and Negative reviews
- Helps in understanding overall sentiment trends clearly

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Learned basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Gained hands-on experience with TextBlob
- Understood sentiment polarity concepts
- Improved data analysis and visualization skills

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Use a larger real-world review dataset
- Add Neutral sentiment analysis with more examples
